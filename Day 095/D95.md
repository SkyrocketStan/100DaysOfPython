# Assignment: Custom API Based Website

## Build a custom website using an API that you find interesting.

Using what you have learnt about HTTP request and REST APIs, in today's project you will build a website that uses data from a public API.

For example, previously we create a rain alert app using a weather API. We also created an ISS tracker and looking into Bitcoin prices, all using a public API.

Today, you get to work on an API that you find interesting and build a service or website based on that API.

Here are some example APIs:

[New York Subway Data](http://nycpulse.herokuapp.com/api)

[Elephant Data](https://elephant-api.herokuapp.com/?ref=public-apis)

[Barcode Generator/Recognition](https://www.cloudmersive.com/barcode-api?ref=public-apis)
