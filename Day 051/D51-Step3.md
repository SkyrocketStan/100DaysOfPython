Step 3 - Get Internet Speeds

1. Use [this speedtest website](https://www.speedtest.net/) to get your current
   live download and upload speeds manually. e.g.

2. Use Selenium and Python to get the same result printed out in your console.
   e.g.

HINT 1: First use Selenium to get the speedtest address, then see which steps
you have to make your bot go through to get those results.

HINT 2: Depending on your internet speeds, you might need to add a 60-180s delay
to wait for the results.

HINT 3: Consider using XPATH, if you can't figure out how to target the element.
