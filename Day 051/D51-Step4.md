Step 4 - Building a Twitter Bot to Tweet at your Internet Provider

1. Go through the process of logging-in and tweeting on Twitter as a human to
   study which selectors/id/classes/XPATHs you could target.

2. Use Python and Selenium to complete the same process, login to Twitter,
   compose the tweet to include your up/down speeds and your promised speeds
   then send the tweet.
   NOTE: If you don't want to mention (@) the internet provider, just compose a
   simple tweet like this:

NOTE: If you are logging into Twitter repeatedly, they will make you complete a
Re-CAPTCHA/send a confirmation code to your email to prove you are human. Go
through this process to continue testing.
