# Step 2 - Create a Class

Because there are multiple steps to this Selenium bot, it's easier if we make
our code organised using a class.

1. Create a class called InternetSpeedTwitterBot

2. In the init() method, create the Selenium driver and 2 other properties down
   and up .

3. Create two methods - get_internet_speed() and tweet_at_provider() .

4. Outside of the class, initialise the object and call the two methods in
   order. Where you first get the internet speed and then tweet at the provider.

HINT: We talked about classes and object in Python extensively in day 16-20,
this might be a good time to revise those lessons if you can't remember how to
do the steps above.
