# Step 2 - Create a Class

Because there are multiple steps to this Selenium bot, it's easier if we make
our code organised using a class.

1. Create a class called InstaFollower

2. In the init() method, create the Selenium driver .

3. Create three methods - login() and find_followers() and follow().

4. Outside of the class, initialise the object and call the three methods in
   order.
