# Step 4 - Find the followers of the target account

When you go to a target Instagram account, you can click on their follower count
to see all their followers e.g.

The URL is the name of the Instagram account added to the end of instagram.com

e.g. https://www.instagram.com/chefsteps/

The list of followers in the popup is limited to around 15 when it first loads,
in order to see more followers, we need to scroll down in the popup (not the
main webpage).

1. See if you can do some research using Google/StackOverflow to figure out how
   to scroll down on the followers popup. Write your code in the
   find_followers() method. This is what you're aiming for:

As a developer, one of the most common things is to find out how to do something
you've never done before. This is a key skill we have to develop.
