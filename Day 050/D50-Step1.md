# Step 1 - Setup your account on Tinder

1. If you don't already have an account on [Tinder](https://tinder.com/), set one up now. Make sure you can sign in to your account using
   Facebook or Google.
<br><br>If you don't want to use your own details, ask a friend who is on Tinder or just set up a new [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) account and
use an AI-generated image from https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/
<br><br>HINT: You can hit refresh on thispersondoesnotexist to generate new random images.


2. Manually go through the process of swiping on profiles and see which elements you'll need to target with your code.
<br><br>NOTE: If you don't want to disappoint anyone (I'm sure you are very attractive/good dating material ðŸ˜œ), you can
   always complete the tutorial and hit "NOPE" on everyone. 
<br><br>Least you break people's hearts by matching with them and
   then telling them "Sorry I just did it for a Python tutorial" ðŸ˜¢. Course
