# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a
# travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.
#
# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21
# to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
#
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.
#
# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
#
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that
# modifies it.
#
# Hint Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function
# should be.
#
# The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very
# important.
#
# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.
