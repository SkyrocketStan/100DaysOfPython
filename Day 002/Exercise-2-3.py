# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

#
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
age = int(age)

# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
years_left = 90 - age
days = years_left * 365
weeks = years_left * 52
months = years_left * 12
print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
