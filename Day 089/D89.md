# Assignment: Disappearing Text Writing App

## An online writing app where if you stop typing, your work will disappear.

For most writers, a big problem is writing block. Where you can't think of what
to write and you can't write anything.

One of the most interesting solutions to this is a web app called The Most
Dangerous Writing App, an online text editor where if you stop writing, all your
progress will be lost.

A timer will count down and when the website detects the user has not written
anything in the last 5/10 seconds, it will delete all the text they've written
so far.

Try it out here:

You are going to build a desktop app that has similar functionality. The design
is up to you, but it should allow a user to type and if they stop for more than
5 seconds, it should delete everything they've written so far.
