# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a
# dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and
# the values are their exam scores.
#
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your
# program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should
# contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final
# version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
#
# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
#
# DO NOT write any print statements.
#
# This is the scoring criteria:
#
# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
