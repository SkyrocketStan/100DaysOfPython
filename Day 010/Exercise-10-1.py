# Instructions In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap
# Year challenge. First, convert this function is_leap() so that instead of
# printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." it should return True if it is a
# leap year and return False if it is not a leap year.

# You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will
# take a year and a month as inputs, e.g.
#
# days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
#
# And it will use this information to work
# out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output, e.g.:
#
# 28
#
# The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January
# to December for a non-leap year. A leap year has 29 days in February.

def is_leap(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False


def days_in_month(year, month):
    month_days = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    if month == 2 and is_leap(year):
        return 29
    else:
        return month_days[month - 1]


# ðŸš¨ Do NOT change any of the code below
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
month = int(input("Enter a month: "))
