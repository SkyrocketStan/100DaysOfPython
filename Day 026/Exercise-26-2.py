# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called
# result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list
# numbers.
#
# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension
# instead of a Loop.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# 🚨 Do Not Change the code above

# Write your 1 line code 👇 below:

result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

# Write your code 👆 above:

print(result)
