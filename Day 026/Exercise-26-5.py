# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called
# weather_f that takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it
# into degrees Fahrenheit.
#
# To convert temp_c into temp_f:
#
# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f
#
# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension
# instead of a Loop.


weather_c = {
    "Monday": 12,
    "Tuesday": 14,
    "Wednesday": 15,
    "Thursday": 14,
    "Friday": 21,
    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†


# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:
weather_f = {day: (temp * 9 / 5) + 32 for (day, temp) in weather_c.items()}

print(weather_f)
