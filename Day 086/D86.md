# Day 86 Assignment: Breakout Game

Breakout was a hit game originally coded up by Steve Wozniak before he and Jobs
started Apple. It's a simple game that is similar to Pong where you use a ball
and paddle to break down a wall.

A good starting point is to review the lessons on Day 22 when we built the Pong
game. But you will have plenty of things to Google, figure out and struggle
through to complete this project. Try to avoid going to a tutorial on how to
build breakout, instead spec out the project, figure out how it's going to work.
Write down a checklist of todos and draw out a flow chart (if it helps).
