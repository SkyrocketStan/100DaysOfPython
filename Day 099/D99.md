# Assignment: Analyse Deaths involving Police in the United States

## Extract insights from combining US census data and the Washington Post's database on deaths by police in the United States.

Today you will do some deep analysis around an incredibly sensitive and politically charged topic. Since Jan. 1, 2015, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. You will analyse this dataset together with US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics. This way we better understand social trends and what is going on with the fatal use of force by the police in the United States.
