# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
#
# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
#
# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
#
# The highest score in the class is: x

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
