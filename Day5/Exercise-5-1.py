# ou are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
#
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
#
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
#
# e.g.
#
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
#
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
#
# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572
#
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
#
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their
# functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†


# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
total_height = 0
total_len = 0
for h in student_heights:
    total_height += h
    total_len += 1


print(round(total_height / total_len))
