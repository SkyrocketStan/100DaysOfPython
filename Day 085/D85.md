# Day 85: Typing Speed Test

Using Tkinter and what you have learnt about building GUI applications with Python, build a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute.

The average typing speed is 40 words per minute. But with practice, you can speed up to 100 words per minute.

If you have more time, you can build your typing speed test into a typing trainer, with high scores and more text samples. You can design your program any way you want.
