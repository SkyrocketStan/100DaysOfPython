# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have
# 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it
# more justice:

#
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

if year % 4 != 0:
    print("Not leap year.")
elif year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 != 0:
    print("Not leap year.")
else:
    print("Leap year.")
