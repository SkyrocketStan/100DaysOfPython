# Assignment: An Online Shop

## An eCommerce website with payment processing.

Using what you have learnt by building the blog website using Flask, you're now going to build your own eCommerce website. Your website needs to have a working cart and checkout.

It should be able to display items for sale and take real payment from users.

It should have login/registration authentication features.

Here is an example website:

You should consider using the Stripe API:
